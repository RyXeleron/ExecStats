### NOTES

Patched (Not Working): The exec was once available, but it's now fixed or blocked, so it doesn’t work anymore.

Not Released (Work in Progress): The exec is still being worked on and hasn’t been made available yet.

Unverified (Unknown/No Info Yet): We don’t have enough information to say if it works or not.

Detected: This exec is flagged by Hyperion Anticheat. If you use it, you will likely get banned for exploiting. There are 4 banwaves your account can take, and if you get more than 4 Hyperion bans, your account will be permanently terminated.

Possibly Detected (above 50% of the executor being detected): There’s a good chance that this tool is being detected and could get you banned. It's more than half likely that it’s flagged by security systems.

Detections Unconfirmed (detections uncertain): We don’t know for sure if this tool is detected or not. There’s no clear information on whether it’s flagged by security systems.

Freemium: has both paid (pros/premium) and free (cons) versions

--------------------------

### Wave

**Status**: *Patched*

Wave has been a topic of controversy, especially the paid version, which claims to be a Level 8 executor but is only Level 3. If you're skeptical, try using the PrintIdentity Validator on ScriptBlox. Despite some users boasting that "Wave has more UNC than Solara," the reality is that Wave's UNC is only 84%. The first release couldn't even execute LUAU scripts properly.

**Key Issues with Wave's early version:**

- **getscriptclosure**: Fails due to the lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **loadstring**: Partially works, but many functions like MoreUNC don't function as intended.
- **sethiddenproperty**: Fails to confirm if the property is hidden.
- **isscriptable**: Incorrectly returns false for non-scriptable properties (e.g., size_xml).
- **setscriptable**: Incorrectly returns false when attempting to set non-scriptable properties.
- **getnamecallmethod**: Fails due to the lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **setfpscap**: Fails for the same reason.
- **getscriptbytecode**: Fails due to the lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **getscripthash**: Also fails for the same reason.
- **getsenv**: Another failure tied to the lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **appendfile**: Fails to append files correctly.
- **request**: Fails due to lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **readfile**: Fails when the file isn't found.

There's speculation that Wave might have skidded some environments from Fluxus, Protosmasher, and Krnl, raising further doubts about its legitimacy.

### **Solara**
- **Overview:** Solara is an exec with no major red flags, but it does have detection issues.
- **Notes:** Since it’s detected, using it could lead to getting flagged and facing bans or restrictions.

### **Incognito / Carbon**
- **Overview:** Incognito (and its AI-based Aimbot variant, Carbon) are pretty average execs. Incognito Beta, in particular, sometimes fails to work as expected.
- **Source:** [Incognito Source](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1234086733247807498/1259752504699256832/incognitosource.zip?ex=668cd372&is=668b81f2&hm=b9ed1f6ed126c6311d43a6c2d3dfffdff0263455c47a8aa26f0ea2d7b636ba78&)

### **Krampus**
- **Overview:** Krampus has a bad reputation due to its Chinese devs who were reportedly involved in a police incident and ran off with the funds.
- **Notes:** The exec is seen negatively due to these issues and the developers' questionable actions.

### **Oxycotin**
- **Overview:** Oxycotin has a notorious reputation. The devs are known for rattering, and the original team was replaced by a new owner involved in various controversies.
- **Details:** They’ve scammed people and falsely claimed the existence of an exploit. More details can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Wbc3nu2-Rt5TonxR-B40aLZjf7pv4kO4p6tRGv6VIEk/mobilebasic).

### **Feather**
- **Overview:** Feather might not be as genuine as it seems. It was initially hyped as a top-tier executor but turned out to be based on skidded (copied) versions of Incognito during its development.
- **Source Code:** The source code for Feather is available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/robloxhackers/comments/1d4gjiq/feather_executor_leak_fullsource_executable/).

### **Celery**
- **Overview:** Celery has some fun features, like changing your identity to names like "69420 LMFAO." However, it suffers from issues with fake or broken UNC functionality, similar to other execs like Solara and Wave.
- **Identity:** Celery’s Identity is rated at 3.

### **Solus, Eulen, Rebound, Xylex, ExInject**
- **Overview:** These wannabe Solara's are known for being rats.

### **Nyx**
-- **Overview:** The owner is a skid and begged Qui to fix his exec multiple times, you can check the screenshot below

### MObile Executors can be detected using these scripts below

up. 4 (somewhat, at least) popular executors
:warning: Remember that most of them will be patched in a short time probably, also remember to check your prints and other stuff, so you wasn’t listening to what players say.

All of those are localscripts. Preferably put in ReplicatedFirst.

:green_square: - Detects on injection (before autoexec executes itself)
:yellow_square: - Detects after injection (after autoexec executes itself, thus bypassable)

:green_square: Trigon Evo:

```lua
game:GetService('ReplicatedStorage').ChildAdded:Connect(function(v)
	if v.Name == 'OSEBackground' and v:IsA('Frame') then
		-- detected. lol. this is an executor ui backup stored there for some reason.
	end
end)
```

:green_square: Delta - NOT A DETECTION, but breaks the UI, can’t close it, execute anything or other stuff:

```lua
game:GetService('TweenService').Name = math.random()
```

:green_square: Vega X - WILL BE PATCHED SHORTLY:

```luagame:GetService('LogService').MessageOut:Connect(function(msg,msgtype)
	if msg:find('Depricated & Drop Support on') and msgtype == Enum.MessageType.MessageWarning then -- yes, it even has grammar issues
		--detected lol
	end
end)
```

:green_square: Evon - couldn’t expect more this youtuber:

```lua
game:GetService('LogService').MessageOut:Connect(function(msg,msgtype)
	if msg == 'Launching Old Evon GUI' and msgtype == Enum.MessageType.MessageOutput then
		--detected. funny
	end
end)
```

### **More ratted execs and scripts**

300+ scripts, including bigger scripts such as:

- VenoxHub

- VenoxWare

- SwagMode

- ScriptsQP (qp hub)

Have been possibly identified to be / or conspiring to be abusing vulnerabilities across all executors, which will likely be used in attempts to steal your information. As a necessary precaution, all 4 of those scripts have now been blacklisted from Solara, and other scripts are being investigated.
