Here's a refined version of the Wave description that maintains the key details and gives it a fresh, clear tone:

---

### Wave

**Status**: *Patched*

Wave has been a topic of controversy, especially the paid version, which claims to be a Level 8 executor but is actually only Level 3. If you're skeptical, try using the PrintIdentity Validator on ScriptBlox. Despite some users boasting that "Wave has more UNC than Solara," the reality is that Wave's UNC is only 84%. The first release couldn't even execute LUAU scripts properly.

**Key Issues with Wave's early version:**

- **getscriptclosure**: Fails due to the lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **loadstring**: Partially works, but many functions like MoreUNC don't function as intended.
- **sethiddenproperty**: Fails to confirm if the property is hidden.
- **isscriptable**: Incorrectly returns false for non-scriptable properties (e.g., size_xml).
- **setscriptable**: Incorrectly returns false when attempting to set non-scriptable properties.
- **getnamecallmethod**: Fails due to the lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **setfpscap**: Fails for the same reason.
- **getscriptbytecode**: Fails due to the lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **getscripthash**: Also fails for the same reason.
- **getsenv**: Another failure tied to the lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **appendfile**: Fails to append files correctly.
- **request**: Fails due to lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **readfile**: Fails when the file isn't found.

There's speculation that Wave might have skidded some environments from Fluxus, Protosmasher, and Krnl, raising further doubts about its legitimacy.

# Solara
Solara has literally no red flag actually, the only thing is it's detected

--------------------------

# Incognito / Carbon

Honestly, they were kinda mid despites how easily for incognito beta to "Not work" but it's just equally as Solara if you have MoreUNC

# Krampus

L Krampus.

If you didn't know, Krampus' Chinese developers were swatted by the police and now they just ran away with the money.

--------------------------

# Oxycotin

Yeah. Self-explanatory right? Everyone knows now.

But for those who don't know, here's the context:

The developers are ratters that have constantly ratted others and bragged about it This server began with two owners, but the current one took control and kicked the other, the full story being told here. https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Wbc3nu2-Rt5TonxR-B40aLZjf7pv4kO4p6tRGv6VIEk/mobilebasic The truth about their exploit. it doesn’t exist. some partners purchased the source but never got it, because apparently the dev “quit” and to this day he still has not gotten the injector, because it doesn’t exist. Even the developers don’t know if this is real, as they thought it was patched.

TDLR : The owners are ratters who don’t have any sort of exploit and has been scamming tons of people, likely planning a rat.

# Feather
DID YOU REALLY THINK FEATHER IS GENUINE?

Eh anyways feathers skidded incognito (When Incognito was still in-development) while saying it has Level 6

# Celery

Celery, despite of having the fact that it also has faked/broken UNCs like Solara and Wave it's kinda fun when you can change your identity to 69420 LMFAO
