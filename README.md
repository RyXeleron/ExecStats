# Wave
### For wave here, the paid version of course has been saying it's Level 8 when it's just Level 3, don't trust me? Use PrintIdentity Validator on ScriptBlox

"yEAh bUT wAvE hAs mOrEUNc tHaN sOlAra"

s**u the real Wave's UNC is 84% and the first release can't even execute LUAU

Wave broken functions:
getscriptclosure failed: [string "DJJVEAh"]:11: No __namecall on game allowed

loadstring failed:[string "DJJVEAh"]:11: No __namecall on game allowed (Loadstring works but only the main part of it, just like MoreUNC)

sethiddenproperty failed: [string "p4aFWOO"]:574: Did not return whether the proberty was hidden

sethiddenproperty failed: [string "p4aFWOO"]:580: Did not return true for the hidden property

isscriptable failed: [string "p4aFWOO"]:599: Did not return false for a non-scriptable property (size_xml)

setscriptable failed: [string "p4aFWOO"]:606: Did not return false for a non-scriptable property (size_xml)

getnamecallmethod failed: [string "DJJVEAh"]:11: No __namecall on game allowed

setfpscap failed: [string "DJJVEAh"]:11: No __namecall on game allowed

getscriptbytecodefailed: [string "DJJVEAh"]:11: No __namecall on game allowed

getscripthash failed: [string "DJJVEAh"]:11: No __namecall on game allowed

getsenv failed: [string "DJJVEAh"]:11: No __namecall on game allowed

appendfile failed: [string "p4aFWOO"]:464: Did not append the file

request failed: [string "DJJVEAh"]:11: No __namecall on game allowed

readfile failed: [string "R51ghzu"]:424: File not found

And it's possible for Wave to skid some enviroments from: Fluxus, Protosmasher, Krnl

# Solara
Solara has literally no red flag actually, the only thing is it's detected

--------------------------

# Incognito / Carbon

Honestly, they were kinda mid despites how easily for incognito beta to "Not work" but it's just equally as Solara if you have MoreUNC

# Krampus

L Krampus.

If you didn't know, Krampus' Chinese developers were swatted by the police and now they just ran away with the money.

--------------------------

# Oxycotin

Yeah. Self-explanatory right? Everyone knows now.

But for those who don't know, here's the context:

The developers are ratters that have constantly ratted others and bragged about it This server began with two owners, but the current one took control and kicked the other, the full story being told here. https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Wbc3nu2-Rt5TonxR-B40aLZjf7pv4kO4p6tRGv6VIEk/mobilebasic The truth about their exploit. it doesn’t exist. some partners purchased the source but never got it, because apparently the dev “quit” and to this day he still has not gotten the injector, because it doesn’t exist. Even the developers don’t know if this is real, as they thought it was patched.

TDLR : The owners are ratters who don’t have any sort of exploit and has been scamming tons of people, likely planning a rat.

Eh anyways feathers skidded incognito (When Incognito was still in-development) while saying it has Level 6
