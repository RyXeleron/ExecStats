### NOTES

Patched (Not Working): The exec was once available, but it's now fixed or blocked, so it doesn’t work anymore.

Not Released (Here): The exec is still being worked on and hasn’t been made available yet.

Unverified (Unknown/No Info Yet): We don’t have enough information to say if it works or not.

Detected: This exec is flagged by Hyperion Anticheat. If you use it, you will likely get banned for exploiting. There are 4 banwaves your account can take, and if you get more than 4 Hyperion bans, your account will be permanently terminated.

Possibly Detected (above 50% of the executor being detected): There’s a good chance that this tool is being detected and could get you banned. It's more than half likely that it’s flagged by security systems.

Detections Unconfirmed (detections uncertain): We don’t know for sure if this tool is detected or not. There’s no clear information on whether it’s flagged by security systems.

--------------------------

### Wave

**Status**: *Patched*

Wave has been a topic of controversy, especially the paid version, which claims to be a Level 8 executor but is actually only Level 3. If you're skeptical, try using the PrintIdentity Validator on ScriptBlox. Despite some users boasting that "Wave has more UNC than Solara," the reality is that Wave's UNC is only 84%. The first release couldn't even execute LUAU scripts properly.

**Key Issues with Wave's early version:**

- **getscriptclosure**: Fails due to the lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **loadstring**: Partially works, but many functions like MoreUNC don't function as intended.
- **sethiddenproperty**: Fails to confirm if the property is hidden.
- **isscriptable**: Incorrectly returns false for non-scriptable properties (e.g., size_xml).
- **setscriptable**: Incorrectly returns false when attempting to set non-scriptable properties.
- **getnamecallmethod**: Fails due to the lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **setfpscap**: Fails for the same reason.
- **getscriptbytecode**: Fails due to the lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **getscripthash**: Also fails for the same reason.
- **getsenv**: Another failure tied to the lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **appendfile**: Fails to append files correctly.
- **request**: Fails due to lack of `__namecall` support on the game.
- **readfile**: Fails when the file isn't found.

There's speculation that Wave might have skidded some environments from Fluxus, Protosmasher, and Krnl, raising further doubts about its legitimacy.

Absolutely, here's a more informal version using "execs" where appropriate:

---

### **Solara**
- **Overview:** Solara is an exec with no major red flags, but it does have detection issues.
- **Notes:** Since it’s detected, using it could lead to getting flagged and facing bans or restrictions.

### **Incognito / Carbon**
- **Overview:** Incognito (and its AI-Based Aimbot variant, Carbon) are pretty average execs. Incognito Beta, in particular, sometimes fails to work as expected.
- **Source:** [Incognito Source](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1234086733247807498/1259752504699256832/incognitosource.zip?ex=668cd372&is=668b81f2&hm=b9ed1f6ed126c6311d43a6c2d3dfffdff0263455c47a8aa26f0ea2d7b636ba78&)

### **Krampus**
- **Overview:** Krampus has a bad reputation due to its Chinese devs who were reportedly involved in a police incident and ran off with the funds.
- **Notes:** The exec is seen negatively due to these issues and the developers' questionable actions.

### **Oxycotin**
- **Overview:** Oxycotin has a notorious reputation. The devs are known for rattering, and the original team was replaced by a new owner involved in various controversies.
- **Details:** They’ve scammed people and falsely claimed the existence of an exploit. More details can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Wbc3nu2-Rt5TonxR-B40aLZjf7pv4kO4p6tRGv6VIEk/mobilebasic).

### **Feather**
- **Overview:** Feather might not be as genuine as it seems. It was initially hyped as a top-tier executor but turned out to be based on skidded (copied) versions of Incognito during its development.
- **Source Code:** The source code for Feather is available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/robloxhackers/comments/1d4gjiq/feather_executor_leak_fullsource_executable/).

### **Celery**
- **Overview:** Celery has some fun features, like changing your identity to names like "69420 LMFAO." However, it suffers from issues with fake or broken UNC functionality, similar to other execs like Solara and Wave.
- **Identity:** Celery’s Identity is rated at 3.

### **Solus, Eulen, Rebound, Xylex, ExInject**
- **Overview:** These wannabe Solara's are known for being rats.
